# Email_Validator
You often receive spam emails that sometimes contain harmful content or links. We usually ignore these kinds of emails, but it can also happen that a few critical emails may end up in spam. And having these emails in spam makes us doubt their validity.

To solve this problem , I am building a website to validate anyone's email.
My approach will be to use an Email Validator API.
